# Communication And Serialization

Communication patterns (nanomsg) and serialization (bond).

More precisely this project mimics Rob Pike's search example introducing Go's channels:

* Query different services (Web Search, Image Search, Video Search, ...)
* Gather and merge results

Instead of using Go and its channels, this project makes use of nanomsg for communication and bond for serialization.
