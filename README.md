# Communication And Serialization

Communication patterns (nanomsg) and serialization (bond).

More precisely this project mimics Rob Pike's search example introducing Go's channels:

* Query different services (Web Search, Image Search, Video Search, ...)
* Gather and merge results

Instead of using Go and its channels, this project makes use of nanomsg for communication and bond for serialization.

## Requirements:

* nanomsg for communication: https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg
* bond for serialization: https://github.com/Microsoft/bond


## Usage:

Start multiple services, such as WebSearch, ImageSearch, VideoSearch.
Now issue queries against the Search service, which dispatches the query and gathers results.
